"""
Performance comparison between sklearn `LogisticRegression`
and pure_sklearn `LogisticRegressionPure`. In the case of
model object size, unpickle latency, and prediction latency
for a single record, we see outperformance with pure_sklearn.

This is meant to illustrate that the pure python implementation
can outperform sklearn. Note that this will not always be the case,
especially as the number of features and classes increases and as
the number of records to predict increases.
